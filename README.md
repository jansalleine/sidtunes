# sidtunes
This is a collection of my released C64 SID music.

## GoatTracker
Mostly done in my own GoatTracker Fork [gt2fork](https://github.com/jansalleine/gt2fork/tree/dev). Some tunes were made with NinjaTracker restrictions in mind and then converted via [gt2nt](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=152424).

## NinjaTracker
Mostly done in my own [NinjaTracker modification](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=152640). Some tunes were imported by [gt2nt](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=152424). Files without file extension are in native C64 PRG format.

## SidWizard
Tunes made with [SID-Wizard](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=221555) by Hermit. Files with swm / swi extension are in native C64 PRG format.
